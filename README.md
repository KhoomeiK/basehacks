We & You is a web platform that effectively crowdsources mental health services from teens for teens. Teens that volunteer as mental health advisors go through a rigorous curriculum and verification process. Teens who need mental help are quickly routed to an available advisor over video call, allowing for close, heart-to-heart conversations without the long lines and strict schedules that suicide hotlines face.
